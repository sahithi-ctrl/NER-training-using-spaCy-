This zipfile contains 3 files: dataset, shared jupyter notebook containing all source code, and this read me file.

Kindly use the the project steps below and the code given in a GPU machine to obtain evaluation metrics.


Project steps
1. Install all the needed dependencies e.g. Spacy. This can be seen in the first cell of the shared notebook

2. Import all dependencies (2nd cell of the shared notebook)

3. Load the CSV

4. Convert CSV into training example using specified spascy standards

5. Load the scibert model

6. Add the entity labels

7. Train the model

8. Save the model using nlp.to_disk

9. Use the model

10. Evaluate model
